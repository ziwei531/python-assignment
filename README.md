# python-assignment
A simple Python Assignment that was done during my Foundation year

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Features included:
1. Appends a new ticket whenever the number 0 is entered on the console.
2. Assigns the ticket onto whichever counter the user has entered between 1 and 4. Subsequently, it would remove that particular ticket off the queue. 
3. Console would display error if there are zero tickets available and would ask the user to append more tickets in order to continue. 
4. Console would not register any inputs that are not intergers entered by the user and displays an appropriate error message.
